# bookstore-api

Hey guys, I'm Lucas.

This API is a simple bookstore to exercise the basic concepts of the Express framework. 

The idea is for a client to work with CRUD operations linked to a server that maintains a collection of books connected to a remote database.

Our REST API is based on the MVC architecture pattern.
